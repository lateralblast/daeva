DAEVA
=====

Download and Automatically Enable Various Applications (for OS X)

Ruby script to download and install latest build of an application.
The code has been made generic so other apps can be added.

Introduction
------------

This script was created to save time with application installations, and keeping
applications up to date. In particular I got fed up of updating applications like
VirtualBox and having to update the separate additions package also, so I automated
it.

Features:

- Checks remote version and local version before downloading (can handle package dates and versions)
- Installs and fixes Gatekeeper and Quarantine information so application runs without asking for approval
- Can do post install if required (e.g. Extensions Pack for VirtualBox)
- Stops running application before upgrading

Supported Package Types:

- DMG
- PKG
- ZIP
- TAR

Supported Application Types:

- app
- pkg
- prefPane
